title: How to Use "Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA" Model on Hugging Face
---

The Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA model is designed to enhance the quality of generative images using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique. Follow this guide to get started with the model.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment
### 1. Install Required Libraries
Make sure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries:
```
bash
pip install transformers diffusers accelerate torch
```
### 2. Clone the Model Repository (Optional)
You can browse the repository directly or clone it to your local machine for reference:
```
bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/strangerzonehf/Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA
cd Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA
```

## Step 2: Load the Model in Python
The model can be used with Hugging Face's `diffusers` library. Here's how to load and use it.

### Code Example
```
python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import torch

# Load the model from Hugging Face
model_id = "strangerzonehf/Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA"

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16
).to("cuda")  # Ensure you have a CUDA-capable GPU

# Set up prompt
prompt = "A futuristic cityscape with glowing neon lights"

# Generate an image
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]

# Save the generated image
image.save("generated_image.png")
```

## Step 3: Fine-Tune the Model (Optional)
You can fine-tune the model using your custom dataset with LoRA layers. Here's a high-level overview:

1. Prepare Your Dataset:
    * Collect images and prompts that match your use case.
    * Ensure the images are preprocessed and formatted correctly (e.g., resolution matching the model’s requirements).
2. Install Additional Libraries:
```
bash
pip install datasets
```
3. Fine-Tuning Script: You can adapt Hugging Face's training scripts to fine-tune the model. For more details, refer to the [Hugging Face Diffusers Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index).

## Step 4: Adjust LoRA Weights
LoRA allows you to adjust specific layers to control the output style. If you want more control over how LoRA modifies the model's behavior, adjust the `scale` parameter during inference:
```
python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, DPMSolverMultistepScheduler
import torch

# Load the model
pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipeline.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipeline.scheduler.config)

# Set LoRA weights
pipeline.unet.set_default_attn_processor(scale=0.8)  # Adjust scale to control adaptation

# Generate an image
prompt = "A dreamy forest with magical lighting"
image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
image.save("dreamy_forest.png")
```

## Step 5: Run Inference on Google Colab (Optional)
If you don’t have a GPU locally, you can use [Google Colab] for free:

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.google/).
2. Enable GPU: Go to Runtime > Change Runtime Type > GPU.
3. Run the following setup code :
    ```
    python
    !pip install transformers diffusers accelerate torch
    from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
    import torch

    model_id = "strangerzonehf/Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA"

    pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
        model_id,
        torch_dtype=torch.float16
    ).to("cuda")

    prompt = "A serene beach during sunset"
    image = pipeline(prompt).images[0]
    image.save("sunset_beach.png")
    ```

4. Download the generated image from Colab.

## Step 6: Experiment with Prompts
The Flux-Midjourney-Mix2-LoRA model excels with detailed prompts. Here are a few examples to try:

* Simple Prompt:
```
A cyberpunk street with holographic signs
```
* Advanced Prompt:
```
A high-resolution digital painting of a futuristic space station orbiting Earth, ultra-realistic, highly detailed, vibrant colors
```
* Abstract Prompt:
```
An ethereal dreamscape with floating islands and waterfalls, glowing softly under a twilight sky
```

## Step 7: Share Your Results
Once you've generated images, share your results! You can:

* Upload them to social media or platforms like [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/).
* Share your prompt and settings to help others replicate the results.

## Additional Tips
* Optimize Performance: Use `torch_dtype=torch.float16` and run the model on a GPU for faster inference.
* Experiment with LoRA Weights: Adjust the scaling to fine-tune how much LoRA modifies the output.
* Explore the Community: Check out other models and examples on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
